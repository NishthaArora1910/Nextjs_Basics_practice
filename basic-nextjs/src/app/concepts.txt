server components by default in NextJS - better security 
for client - 'use client' at top of the page
cannot use hooks in server components only in clients
at root level we should have file name page.js 

account , products - route
membership - nested route

dynamic route - [details]
catch all route - [...product-review]

<Link> tag - from one page to another -> next/link
useRouter -> next/navigation -- When using it you need to convert this component as client components 

Client side data fetching - // useEffect hook
//swr , useSwr hook
